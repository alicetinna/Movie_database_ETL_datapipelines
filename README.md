# Movie_database_ETL_datapipelines

The aim of this project was to combine 20-CSV file into one.
After making one CSV file, to check the data for missing values and performing data cleaning and manipulations.
For that here I have created various data pipelines to perform the task.
After performing all the task the final csv is loaded back to the destination.
This projects gives simple idea of how ETL process works.
